## Background

Finished project for COSC-3339 Software Engineering at St. Edward's Universtiy.
Originally worked on in BitBucket but transferred into GitHub for sharing purpsoes.

## Project

WeGo Service seeks to provide scalable transportation as a service (TaaS) solutions. This is our first public release and our first alpha. We are neither feature complete nor stable but the core functionality is implemented.
